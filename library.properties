sentence=An Arduino compatible, non-blocking, I2C/SPI library for the Bosch BMP388 barometer. 
paragraph=The BMP388 library can operate the barometer in either NORMAL or FORCED modes. NORMAL mode automatically samples at the device 
sample rate. It supports both polling or interrupt driven measurements, (using the BMP388's external INT) pin. 
This library can also store and burst read up to 72 pressure and temperature measurements using the BMP388's internal 512 byte FIFO memory.
