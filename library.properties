sentence=An Arduino compatible, non-blocking, I2C/SPI library for the Bosch BMP388 barometer. 
paragraph=This library can operate the BMP388 in either NORMAL or FORCED modes. NORMAL mode automatically samples at the device 
sample rate. It can also use polling or interrupt driven measurements, (using the BMP388's external INT) pin. It also supports
storage and burst read of up to 72 pressure and temperature measurements using the Barometer's internal 512 byte FIFO memory.
